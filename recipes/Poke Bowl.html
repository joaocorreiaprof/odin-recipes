<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    A Poke Bowl is a popular and colorful Hawaiian dish that typically consists of a base of sushi rice or greens, topped with diced raw fish (such as tuna or salmon), fresh vegetables like avocado, cucumber, and radish, and often garnished with sesame seeds. The ingredients are then seasoned with various sauces like soy sauce, sesame oil, or spicy mayo, providing a burst of flavors. Poke Bowls are known for their vibrant presentation and a perfect balance of flavors, making them a healthy and delicious choice for a meal.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ahi Tuna</li>
        <li>The seasonings sauce</li>
        <li>Veggies</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
        <li>Sriracha</li>
        <li>Green onion and black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Brown rice</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>      
	<ol>
		<li>Cook the rice. Brown rice takes a little longer to cook than white rice, so be aware of that. My rice cooker usually cooks it in about 40 minutes. You can also do this step ahead of time.</li>
		<li>Marinate the tuna. Use a VERY sharp knife to cut the ahi tuna into a bite-size dice. Add to a medium bowl. Stir with soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, and sesame oil. Let the ahi tuna marinate while you prep the rest of the ingredients.</li>
		<li>Make the spicy mayo. Add the mayo and sriracha to a small bowl. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Add the mayo to a small ziplock baggie. Cut a small piece of the corner off.</li>
		<li>Assemble the bowls. Told you this was easy! Spoon the cooked rice into a bowl. Spoon the marinated tuna over the rice. Arrange the cucumber, carrot, and edamame around it. Fan out the avocado on top. Sprinkle with sesame deeds and chopped green onion. Drizzle with spicy mayo.</li>
