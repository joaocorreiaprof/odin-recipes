Project: Recipes

Introduction

This project is a part of The Odin Project, involving the creation of a dynamic website to showcase a collection of recipes. Throughout the development of this website, I gained hands-on experience and knowledge in HTML, significantly enhanced my proficiency in Git and GitHub, and explored various HTML elements and tags. These include incorporating images, creating links, organizing content using ordered and unordered lists, and much more.

Skills Demonstrated

Upon completing this project, I have demonstrated the following skills:

Proficiency in HTML and its elements.
Effective usage of Git and GitHub for version control.
Integration of images, links, animations, and styles using CSS within a web page.
Structuring content using ordered and unordered lists.
Understanding the concepts of cascade, and effectively utilizing IDs and classes for styling and organization.
This project remains in constant development as I continue to expand my knowledge and skills. The implementation of cascade, IDs, and classes has added depth to the design and functionality of the website. I look forward to further refining this project and utilizing these skills in future projects, continuously improving my understanding of web development concepts.
