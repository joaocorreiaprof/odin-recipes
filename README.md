Project: Recipes

Introduction

This project is part of The Odin Project, and it involves building a website that features recipes. Throughout the development of this website, I gained hands-on experience and knowledge in HTML, enhanced my proficiency in Git and GitHub, and explored various HTML elements and tags. These included incorporating images, creating links, organizing content with ordered and unordered lists, and much more.

Upon completing this project, I have demonstrated the following skills:

Proficiency in HTML and its elements
Effective usage of Git and GitHub for version control
Integration of images and links within a web page
Structuring content using ordered and unordered lists
Creating an aesthetically pleasing and functional webpage for showcasing Hawaiian recipes
This project has provided valuable practical insights and a solid foundation to further build upon my web development skills. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and continuously improving my understanding of web development concepts.
